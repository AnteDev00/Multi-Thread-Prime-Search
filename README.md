# Prime-and-Multi-Threads

The project features an algorithm to search and verify the primality of numbers, displaying relevant information on the console, including a label for "compositeness." 

It employs parallelization with careful synchronization and equal work distribution among threads. Additional functionalities, like time measurement, are incorporated, and the project follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
