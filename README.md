# Prime-and-Threads

The project implements an algorithm for searching numbers and checking their primality. Information about primality and factors is printed on the console, along with a label indicating the "compositeness" of the number.

The implementation allows parallelization of the process with special attention to synchronization and even distribution of work among "threads." Additional functionalities, such as time measurement and other details, are included.

The project is programmed according to the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
